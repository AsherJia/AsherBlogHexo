# Polyfill
[Polyfill](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/#top)

> npm install --save babel-polyfill

Babel includes a polyfill that includes a custom regenerator [runtime](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/blob/master/runtime.js) and [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js).

This will emulate a full ES2015 environment and is intended to be used in an application rather than a library/tool. This polyfill is automatically loaded when using `babel-node`.

# Stage-X(Experimental Presets)

Any transforms in stage-x presets are changes to the language that havenâ€™t been approved to be part of a release of Javascript (such as ES6/ES2015).

> "Changes to the language are developed by way of a process which provides guidelines for evolving an addition from an idea to a fully specified feature"

The TC39 categorizes proposals into the following stages:

* [stage-0](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-0/) - Strawman: just an idea, possible Babel plugin.
* [stage-1](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-1/) - Proposal: this is worth working on.
* [stage-2](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-2/) - Draft: initial spec.
* [stage-3](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-3/) - Candidate: complete spec and initial browser implementations.
* stage-4 - Finished: will be added to the next yearly release.

Also check out the current TC39 proposals and its process document.
