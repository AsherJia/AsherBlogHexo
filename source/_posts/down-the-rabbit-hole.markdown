When people find out I’m a self-taught software engineer, they often say, “I want to do that. How did you teach yourself to program?”

“你是如何自学编程的，可以教教我吗？”， 当人们发现我是一名自学成才的软件工程师时。

I can say it all in 5 words. Go down the rabbit hole.

我用一个谚语来形容：进入兔子洞。

In Alice In Wonderland, Alice sees something utterly fascinating to her: a rabbit with a watch. She’s so intrigued that she chases after it and goes down a mysterious hole.

在爱丽丝梦游仙境中，她被一直带着眼镜的兔子彻底吸引了。在好奇心的趋势下，她开始追逐这只兔子，并接跟着他进入了一个神秘的洞穴。

“She had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran after it.”

“她从来没有见过一只穿着口袋马甲，并且带着眼镜的兔子。这引起了她极大地兴趣并开始跟随它”

Find what is fascinating to you about programming and chase after it. Go down the rabbit hole.

在编程方面找到一个吸引你的地方，并且开始深入。 进入兔子洞。

I never planned on becoming a software engineer. I dropped out of college and I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. After seeing my big sister code, I got a little curious about it. I decided to forget about what I ‘should’ do with my life or what I was ‘supposed’ to learn. I started coding. I started Googling. I followed my curiosity.

我从未计划成为一名软件工程师。我大学辍学之后，很迷茫。不知道这辈子该做些什么。在我看到我大姐的代码后，我产生了一些好奇心。我决定抛开想我这辈子应该学什么。我开始编程，开始google。一些都跟随我的好奇心来走。

Much like when Alice follows after the white rabbit, I had no idea where this path would lead to. I just knew I had to find out.

就想爱丽丝跟随那只白色的兔子，我不知道这条路会通向哪里。我只知道，我要找到答案。

My favorite podcast episode — ever — is one in which T.K Coleman and Isaac Morehouse talk about being irresponsibly curious. Their point is that we try to be well-rounded, follow a practical path, and focus on what we’re ‘supposed’ to know. When we do that, we end up half-knowing a bunch of things that don’t inspire us and that we don’t care about. Yet if you want to truly learn, find what you’re curious about and chase after it.

我最喜欢的广播谈话类节目，"曾经"。 T.K Coleman 和 Isaac Morehouse 谈论不计后果的好奇。他们的专注于如何在各方面全面发展，并且专注于我们应该知道什么。 当我们这样做的时候，对于大多数事情停留在一知半解的情况下，不会吸引我们去继续深究。 所以，如果你想真正的去学习一件事，找到你的兴趣点，并且深究它。

“The more irresponsibly curious you are about the pursuit of knowledge, the more everything becomes interesting”. -T.K Coleman.
People said I should do the responsible thing and go back to college. But I didn’t. I decided to irresponsibly chase my curiosity. I went down the rabbit hole, and I knew some people thought I was crazy. I was a college dropout, I was living with my parents and I was spending all my time coding, something that many believe a woman or a dropout cannot pursue as a career. Yet I didn’t care. I let go of what path I was supposed to be on. Later, I realized I had discovered my biggest passion. I did an unpaid engineering internship and eventually got my first job as a software engineer.

"当你越渴望的追求知识的时候，你会发现越来越多的事情变得有趣。". -T.K Coleman.
人们说我应当做一些有责任心的事，并且回到学校。但是我没有这样做，我决定义无反顾的去追寻我感兴趣的事。我想深入兔子洞并且我知道大多数人认为我很疯狂。我是一个辍学生，我跟父母生活在一起并且花全部的时间去编程。很多人相信一个女人或者一个辍学生无法从事工作。然而我并不关心。我放弃了自己原本应该走的路。后来，我意识到我发现了自己最发的兴趣。我从一个不计报酬的工程师开始，最终获得了我的第一份软件工程师的工作。

I didn’t set out to be a software engineer. I chased after my curiosity and one day realized I had become one.

我一直在追逐自己的好奇心，直到有一天我意识到自己已经成为了一名软件工程师。

What fascinates you? What is your white rabbit?

是什么让你着迷？你的白兔子是什么？

Find out and chase after it. Go down the rabbit hole.

找到并且追逐他。深入兔子洞。

It will only be a matter of time before you find yourself in Wonderland.

发现属于你的仙境只是时间问题。
