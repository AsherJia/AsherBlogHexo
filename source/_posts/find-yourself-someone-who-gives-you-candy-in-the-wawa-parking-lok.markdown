Earlier tonight, in the midst of a nervous breakdown caused by the stresses of the life of a typical twenty-three year old, I decided that ice cream was a necessity. I don’t know about you, but I stress eat. A lot. And ice cream is almost always a go to.

傍晚时分，在一个典型的23岁由于压力而导致精神崩溃的年纪，一个冰激凌是必须的。我不认识你，只是埋头吃。毕竟，冰激凌是要吃完的。

I went to my freezer in hopes of finding something to soothe my palette, but instead a bag of frozen veggies stared me back in the face.
我想去冰箱里找一些东西来舒缓来放松自己，然而映入眼帘的却是一袋冰冷的蔬菜。

How disappointing.
多么令人失望

I love my greens, but when I need something carby and sweet, a frozen bag of brussel sprouts is just not going to be of any help.
我喜欢绿色蔬菜，但是当我需要一些甜食的时候，一袋冰冷的芽球甘蓝并没有任何帮助。

I was reluctant to grab money, get in the car and go to Wawa, as I am doing my best(or so I thought) to save money, but I figured a couple dollars wouldn't undermine my goal of buying a car by the start of summer.

我很不情愿的抓起钱，上车去wawa，而是找到了一些并不会削减我准备在初夏买车的一些钱。

For those poor souls who are not aware of what a "Wawa" is, I will enlighten you on all its glory. Wawa is a gas station doubling as a convenience store. This said convenience store provides you with the option of getting subs, sandwiches, burritos, breakfast food and so much more made for you right then and there. They also sell chips, fruit, yogurt, coffee, snacks on snacks and well, ice cream for people like me that need a sweet tooth fixin' at eleven o'clock at night.

对于一些人来说或许他们并不知道什么是"Wawa", 我会像你介绍它所有的光荣。 ”Wawa“是一个加油站兼职便利店。也就是说便利店会提供给你一些选择，三明治，墨西哥卷，早餐食物和一些你觉得哪里应该有的东西。他们也卖薯条，水果，酸奶，咖啡和一些零食，冰激凌给像我这样想要在半夜11点吃甜食的人。

I got out of my dads car, as he also went to get a little something something for himself, walked inside to grab mu beloved chocolate chip cookie dough frozen yumminess and went outside to the car to wait for my dad to finish.
